        <h1>FPGA Computer</h1>
        <p>I had no idea what FPGA boards were until very recently. 
          I was looking for software that would let me emulate computers (e.g. 6502) using a hardware defintion language. 
          That's when I stumbled upon FPGA boards and found that the most commone use for HDL's is to synthesize (compile) it to run on FPGA's.
           It then became apparent to me that this reprogrammable hardware is what hardware/circuit deisgners use to test their designs.</p>
        <p>For this project I am working on recreating the Hack CPU on a FPGA board. It might seem as simple as re-writing the CPU, ROM, and RAM in VHDL or Verilog but that is not the case. The Hack CPU interacts with I/O via memory addresses but that part is abstracted from The Elements of Computing book. In reality you need to have hardware setup to interace with a keyboard and monitor. For this project I am trying have it work with a PS/2 keybaord and a simple black and white pixel composite video output.</p>

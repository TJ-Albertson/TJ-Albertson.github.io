        <h1>Cloudbox</h1>
        <p>Social file sharing app built with React frontend, Node/Express.js backend, and MongoDB. The main page is a customizeable panel of boxes. Each box has all of the users files and can be shared with others. You can select which boxes you want to see, out of the ones that have been shared with you, on your main page.</p>
        <p>The user can upload files and create folders in their box. The box also has a navigation bar at the top. The user can customize their profile picture and bio. The app uses Auth0 for authentication although initially I handled it myself by encrypting the password and storing it in MongoDB. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, this project was a little too ambitious and I only have a demo to show. Initially my plan was host this on one of my home servers and use it with my friends/family but I lost and interest and didn't think it was worth the effort.</p>

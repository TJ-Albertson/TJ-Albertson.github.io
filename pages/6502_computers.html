        <h1>6502 Computer</h1>
        <p>This is a physical computer I am working on right now based around the 6502 processor. It has a ROM, RAM, VIA, LCD screen, and a clock I built with a manual mode switch connected to it. So right now it can really only do text programs.</p>
        <p>I picked the 6502 because it represents the first big step, in my opinion, in consumer computers and video games. With the NES, Commodore, and Apple II, computers took a huge leap from being kinda cool to really cool. </p>
        <p>I am going to add a PS/2 keyboard input, which is pretty easy to integrate with the VIA, and a TMS9918 which is going to be a bit more difficult. I picked the TMS9918 because it is very similar to the graphics processor used in the NES. Luckily there are some similar projects I've found online that use the TMS9918 and there is even a guide to set it up with SRAM as opposed to DRAM with which it was originally intended. SRAM is more readily available nowadays and a lot easier to work with on these retro computers.</p>
        <p>If you're wondering why it's not completely connected in the photo it's becuase I have rebuilt it several times. I wanted it to lay it out with defined Address, Data, and Control buses which has turned out to be more trouble than it is worth.</p>
        <p>Also on the left you can see the arduino that I hook up to the buses for troubleshooting.</p>

        <h1>6502 Computer</h1>
        <p>This is a physical computer I am working on right now based around the 6502 processor. Right now it just has a ROM, RAM, VIA, LCD screen, and a clock I built with a manual mode connected to it. So at most right now it can run text programs.</p>
        <p>I picked the 6502 because it represents the first big step, in my opinion, in consumer comptures and video games. With the NES, Commodore, and Apple II computers took a huge leap from being kinda cool to really cool. </p>
        <p>I am going to add PS/2 keyboard input, which is pretty easy to integrate with the VIA, and a TMS9918 which is a bit more difficult. I picked the TMS9918 because it is very similar to the graphics processor use in the NES. Luckily there are some similar projects I've found online that use the TMS9918 and I even found a guide to set with SRAM vs DRAM as it was intended. </p>
